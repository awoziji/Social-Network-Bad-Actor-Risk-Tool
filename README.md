### This analysis uses social network analysis to develop a risk tool to improve building safety

The Department of Buildings issues approximately 300,000 building permits a year, a number of these permits will result in illegal work. The idea behind this project was to use network measures to categorize construction permits as high and produce a list of building to audited or inspected.

Each construction permit contains the names of the actors working on the project. These include the owner, architect or engineer, contractor and filing representative. Each permit produces a network of actors working at a building in New York City.

A bad actor list is generated based on previous illegal work or dispositions.
